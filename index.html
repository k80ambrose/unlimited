	<h1>CAPITAL UNLIMITED</h1>
	<p>
		At 4:30 PM<br>
		We left union station<br>
		Embarking on<br>
		what was supposed to be<br>
		A 17 hour trip<br>
		In the moments preceding we<br>

		s beside the vessel<br>
		A man hands me a slip of paper<br>
		A man stands behind me<br>
		I look at him and <br>
		He looked at me and<br>
		I find the eyecontact unsettling so I<br>
		turn around<br>
		and board the train<br>
		before me there’s a fat man struggling to fit his floral suitcase in the place where we were supposed to put our suitcases<br>
		“im a newbie” he said<br>
		“me too” i replied<br>
		“you’re much cuter than i am”<br>
		Sitting in the seat next to mine is<br>
		the man who was behind me in line<br>
		before me there’s a woman who didn’t shave her legs<br>
		But just the bottom half<br>
		Like<br>
		thighs were shaved<br>
		calves weren’t<br>
		I wonder<br>
		across the aisle diagonally<br>
		A man dons one of those		.	What inspired that stylistic choice?<br>
		masks that’s like the		.	was it like something that happened<br>
		Republicanesque foreskin	.	in the shower without a thought or <br>
		you know those cylinders	.	was it deliberate? <br>
		of fabric. Masking Politics<br>
		are bad we shouldn’t<br>
		Assume things about each<br>
		Other. He plays Mario Kart on <br>
		A Silver Gameboy<br>
		I’m somewhere with trees<br>
		When asked, are you ready to get off?<br>
		She said “yes sir!”<br>
		Isn’t it funny how we can’t read anymore<br>
		At 11:11 I made a wish<br>
		typed out my wish<br>
		Then deleted it<br>
		Because if you tell anyone your wish<br>
		Even your phone <br>
		It doesnt come true<br>
		And my wish was kind of important<br>
		They liked my jacket and that’s how the interaction started<br>
		I was in a booth eating a hot dog<br>
		Who knew i was going to get so drunk on this train?<br>
		Me and the millennials talked about how awful reality was<br>
		And how the world was burning I forgot their names already<br>
		One of them asked for my instagram<br>
		In a city with some kind of waterway and a blue building that says High Mark<br>
		j tbinn tbjs night ve cleaveland?<br>
		whoever was in this bathroom last <br>
		was wearing perfume<br>
		the pleasant odor lingered<br>
		and im thankful for that<br>

		The train attendant <br>
		Asked where he was<br>
		I said idk<br>
		The one i was cubing with said that’s worrisome and<br>
		He never came back<br>
		I like it here down low real low real down low to the tracks<br>
		Doing squats now<br>
		Feels so good to move again<br>
		There’s a tiny stool<br>
		I thought taking the train would be more dignified experience than by plane but it turns out to be just as soul sucking and exhaustingly frigid<br>
		A man came into the women’s lounge<br>
		Peed<br>
		Then apologized<br>
		He “didn't see you there”<br>
		He seemed nice and earnest<br>
		I’m somewhere with houses<br>
		“This is the last time i'm ever doing this” said everyone on the train<br>
		The smell of my earwax is comfortable in this public place<br>
		Where all smells are foreign<br>
		Train paused<br>
		For a moment<br>
		Corey and the other one biked 60 miles each day<br>
		One of them got propositioned to a threesome at a bar<br>
		Along this trail (the appalachian)<br>
		But respectfully declined because <br>
		her trail boyfriend was sitting right there<br>
		While she was hitting on him<br>
		And he was visibly sad she was talking to<br>
		This other dude and it was sad the whole<br>
		Thing was sad<br>
		She said “pringles are best when you eat them in threes”<br>
		The grizzly lawyer made a seductive face mimicking the seductive face she made<br>
		Im eating peanut m&ms somewhere i heard<br>
		One<br>
		 peanut <br>
		m&m <br>
		equals <br>
		One<br>
		Whole<br>
		Lap<br>
		Around<br>
		The<br>
		Track<br>
		You<br>
		Fat<br>
		Fuck<br>
		In terms of like<br>
		Calories you need to burn in order to cancel the food out<br>
		It was my mistake to wear shorts on the train<br>
		in my defense the shorts were long<br>
		to my detriment the shorts were white<br>
		for a while i lay frigid in the fetal position<br>
		the man across the aisle offered me his avengers blanket<br>
		I take it and sleep<br>
		While i sleep i dream about ant man<br>
		But mostly about paul rudd<br>
		Somewhere people live<br>
		On July Fourth Twenty Twenty One<br>
		The train stopped<br>
		I gave the man back his blanket<br>
		He got off at south bend<br>
		One time i went to south bend by accident<br>
		I got off at the wrong stop<br>
		It was a date<br>
		My wish was that i don’t “die on this train”<br>
		On the way home I<br>
		stuck my head out the window <br>
		like a dog<br>
		my uber driver’s cousin owns the smoke shop on 53rd<br>
