At 4:30 PM Eastern Time<br>
We left union station<br>
Embarking on<br>
what was supposed to be<br>
A 17 hour trip<br>

A man hands me a slip of paper<br>
A man stands behind me<br>
I look at him and <br>
He looked at me and<br>
I find the eyecontact unsettling so I<br>
turn around<br>
and board the train<br>
before me there’s a fat man struggling to fit his floral suitcase in the place where we were supposed to put our suitcases<br>
“im a newbie” he said<br>
“me too” i replied<br>
“you’re much cuter than i am”<br>
Sitting in the seat next to mine is<br>
the man who was behind me in line<br>
before me there’s a woman who didn’t shave her legs<br>
But just the bottom half<br>
Like<br>
thighs were shaved<br>
calves weren’t<br>
I wonder<br>
across the aisle diagonally<br>
A man dons one of those		What inspired that stylistic choice?

Republicanesque foreskin		in the shower without a thought or

of fabric. Masking Politics
are bad we shouldn’t
Assume things about each
Other. He plays Mario Kart on 
A Silver Gameboy
I’m somewhere with trees
When asked, are you ready to get off?
She said “yes sir!”

Isn’t it funny how we can’t read anymore
At 11:11 I made a wish
typed out my wish
Then deleted it
Because if you tell anyone your wish
Even your phone 
It doesnt come true
And my wish was kind of important

They liked my jacket and that’s how the interaction started
I was in a booth eating a hot dog

Who knew i was going to get so drunk on this train?

Me and the millennials talked about how awful reality was
And how the world was burning I forgot their names already
One of them asked for my instagram
In a city with some kind of waterway and a blue building that says High Mark
j tbinn tbjs night ve cleaveland?
whoever was in this bathroom last 
was wearing perfume
the pleasant odor lingered
and im thankful for that

The train attendant 
Asked where he was
I said idk
The one i was cubing with said that’s worrisome and
He never came back
I like it here down low real low real down low to the tracks
Doing squats now
Feels so good to move again
There’s a tiny stool
I thought taking the train would be more dignified experience than by plane but it turns out to be just as soul sucking and exhaustingly frigid
A man came into the women’s lounge
Peed
Then apologized
He “didn't see you there”
He seemed nice and earnest
I’m somewhere with houses
“This is the last time i'm ever doing this” said everyone on the train
The smell of my earwax is comfortable in this public place
Where all smells are foreign
Train paused
For a moment
Corey and the other one biked 60 miles each day
One of them got propositioned to a threesome at a bar
Along this trail (the appalachian)
But respectfully declined because 
her trail boyfriend was sitting right there
While she was hitting on him
And he was visibly sad she was talking to
This other dude and it was sad the whole
Thing was sad
She said “pringles are best when you eat them in threes”
The grizzly lawyer made a seductive face mimicking the seductive face she made
Im eating peanut m&ms somewhere i heard

Fuck
In terms of like
Calories you need to burn in order to cancel the food out

It was my mistake to wear shorts on the train
In my defense the shorts were long
To my detriment the shorts were white
Frigid n the fetal position
The man across offers me his avengers blanket
I take it and sleep
While i sleep i dream about ant man
But mostly about paul rudd
Somewhere people live
On July Fourth Twenty Twenty One
The train stopped
I gave the man back his blanket
He got off at south bend
One time i went to south bend by accident
I got off at the wrong stop
It was a date
My wish was that i don’t “die on this train”
On the way home I
stuck my head out the window 
like a dog
my uber driver’s cousin owns the smoke shop on 53rd
